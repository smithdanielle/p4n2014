# Modular code

Code redundancy (i.e. cut-and-paste to replicate current functionality) is bad! Each part of the code should function independently of the others.

"Modular python code" encompasses three aspects of code layout:

1. **Chunk code into semantic units:** Semantically related lines should be close; comments can make this explicit.
2. **Create functions for things you do often:** Whenever you feel like copy-pasting, make a function!

``` python
def nameFunction(argument, acceptedKeys=None):
	# do stuff here
	return output
	
nameFunction('input',[return])
```
3. **Creating classes and modules:** Put related functions and data in a class and/or module to make relatedness explicit.

	- I need to learn more about using classes!

> NB: Script editor `Spyder` looks amazing, similar to `RStudio` for `R`; includes help viewer etc.

Only use these elements of modular code when the benefit of clarity outweighs the cost of complexity.
